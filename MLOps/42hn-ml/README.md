# 42HN x appliedAI: Machine Learning & MLOps

Welcome to the Machine Learning & MLOps Assignments repository for students of 42 Heilbronn! This repository offers hands-on assignments across three key areas of machine learning, designed to help you develop practical skills in both ML and MLOps.

- [Part 1](https://github.com/aai-institute/42hn-ml/blob/main/part-1.md) introduces you to regression tasks and tracking experiments.
- [Part 2](https://github.com/aai-institute/42hn-ml/blob/main/part-2.md) focuses on classification models and deploying your trained models using a serving API.
- [Part 3](https://github.com/aai-institute/42hn-ml/blob/main/part-3.md) covers pipeline orchestration, enabling you to automate and manage end-to-end ML workflows.
